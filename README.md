Python_vs_R-Head_to_head_Data_Analysis

Head to head comparison of python and R for data analysis

This repository follows the article https://www.dataquest.io/blog/python-vs-r/.

I came across this article while doing my research on which language is better to use for data analysis.
I found this article very useful in my decision.

This repository just contains all the code and analysis example from this article in two different code files, one with all R code and the other with all the Python code.

nba_2013.csv is the data file that goes with the code.
